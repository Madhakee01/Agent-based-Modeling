# Agent-based-Modeling
Learning Agent-based Modeling with Net-logo to simulate the spread of a hypothetical virus through close contact between agents(humans) in a world. By using agent based modeling, I believe we might be able to better understand the complex phenomena of virus spreading. In this process I will be learning NetLogo which is a powerful simulation environments.
